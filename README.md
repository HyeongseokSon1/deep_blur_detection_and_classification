# deep_blur_detection_and_classification

Tensorflow implementation of "Defocus and Motion Blur Detection with Deep Contextual Features"

For image examples:

![input2](./input/out_of_focus0607.jpg) ![output2](./output/out_of_focus0607.png)

This repository contains a test code and sythetic dataset, which consists of scenes including motion and defocus blurs together in each scene.

--------------------------

## Prerequisites (tested)
- Ubuntu 16.04
- Tensorflow 1.6.0 (<= 1.9.0)
- Tensorlayer 1.8.2
- OpenCV2

## Train Details
- We used [CUHK blur detection dataset](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~leojia/projects/dblurdetect/dataset.html) for training our network and generating our synthetic dataset
- Train and test set lists are uploaded in 'dataset' folder

## Test Details
- download [model weights](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11FBVmAIfeHDHpOjLXewzpA2lgcOOqo2_/view?usp=sharing) from google drive and save the model into 'model' folder.
- specify a path of input folder in 'main.py' at line #39
- run 'main.py'

```bash
python main.py
```
## Synthetic Dataset
- download [synthetic train set](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QUygL2nalHldcJMwFJPfPFWokMoIbI9L/view?usp=sharing)(337MB) and [synthetic test set](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-lV3CS_6rI_by6StkGQYsdn0SeOxwepu/view?usp=sharing)(11.5MB) from google drive
- Note that sharp pixels, motion-blurred pixels, and defocus-blurred pixels in GT blur maps are labeled as 0, 100, and 200, respectively, in the [0,255] range.

## About Coupe Project ##
Project ‘COUPE’ aims to develop software that evaluates and improves the quality of images and videos based on big visual data. To achieve the goal, we extract sharpness, color, composition features from images and develop technologies for restoring and improving by using it. In addition,ersonalization technology through userreference analysis is under study.
